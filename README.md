# Intelligent Systems Lab Assignment - Evolutionary Computation
## Overview
This repository is created for educational purposes as part of the Intelligent Systems Lab Assignment. It aims to foster understanding of evolutionary computation techniques and encourage experimentation with genetic algorithms in solving combinatorial optimization problems.

## Features
* Generic Genetic Algorithm: Design and implementation of a flexible genetic algorithm allowing easy customization of genotype representations, selection methods, crossover and mutation strategies, and various parameters.
* Knapsack Problem: Solving the 0-1 Knapsack Problem, optimizing the selection of items to maximize the total value while adhering to a given weight constraint.
* Traveling Salesman Problem: Addressing the Traveling Salesman Problem to find the shortest route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city.
