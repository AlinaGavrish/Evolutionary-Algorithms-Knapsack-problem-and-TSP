# Intelligent Systems Lab Assignment - Evolutionary Computation
## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of genetic programming solutions for two standard AI problems: the Knapsack Problem and the Traveling Salesman Problem. The project includes the development of a generic genetic algorithm along with application-specific operators and fitness evaluation.

## Features
* Generic Genetic Algorithm: Design and implementation of a flexible genetic algorithm allowing easy customization of genotype representations, selection methods, crossover and mutation strategies, and various parameters.
* Knapsack Problem: Solving the 0-1 Knapsack Problem, optimizing the selection of items to maximize the total value while adhering to a given weight constraint.
* Traveling Salesman Problem: Addressing the Traveling Salesman Problem to find the shortest route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city.
